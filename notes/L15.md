# Image Processing

### Discrete Values
- digial information like bit, bytes, characters, etc.
- think of lights being either on or off

### Analog informaiton
- continuous range of values
- real numbers or floats
- think of lights that can be dimmed

### Image File Format (Compressed Types)
- GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) ~ lossy compression and a color palette of up to 256 of the most prevalent colors
- JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) ~ lossless compression and lossy scheme

### Properties of Images
- two-dimensial grid starts at (0, 0) so width = width -1 and height is the same way

### Images Module
- open source, non-standard module included in python
- `image.getWidth()`
- `image.getHeight()`
- or just do `print(image)`
- `image.getPixel(0, 0)` ~ gives you the RGB at the selected coordinates
- `image.setPixel(x, y, color)` ~ set the color of the pixel
- `image.save("file.type")` ~ saves the file
- pixel RGB values are stored in a Tuple
