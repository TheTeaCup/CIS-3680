PA #5 - Hunter Wilson

A list is sorted in ascending order if it is empty 
or each item except the last one is less than or equal to its successor. 
Define a function called is_sorted that expects a list as an argument and
returns True if the list is sorted, or returns False otherwise. 
Include a brief main program to demonstrate the function.
(Hint: For a list of length 2 or greater, 
loop through the list and compare pairs of items, 
from left to right, and return False if the first item in a pair is greater.)
